This application was made with react 

I'm gonna focus on the files structure first.
    - a folder for the whole page and scss
    - a folder for reusable components
    - a folder for assets (svg files)

I made some changes and tests with axio so that I'm sure the right data goes to the right components

I started working on the reusable components first 
after I was done with the HTML I worked on the css of the card 

Then I started working on the Page

After I was done it was time to think about the responsiness for mobile
which was done after many trials and errors to be honest 

I then thought about implementing an animation for a mobile menu 
for mobile but did not find one I liked enough

I then implemented the links and hover animation 

Then I thought about Some animation for the Navbar instead
But I realise that it was actually in te design's instruction already
